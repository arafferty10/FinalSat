# ActiveSAT360 

An immersive satellite visualization experience

## How to use

ActiveSAT360 is built to be a social and immersive display. Each user creates a nickname which is tied to their device upon initializing. The user presses the "shuffle" button to display the information about a particular satellite on their smartphone. They can then "ping" their satellite by tapping on the area below the information box.

When the screen is tapped, the assigned satellite takes on a larger size until the screen is released. Participants can begin to understand the visualization by shuffling through and exploring the exhibit. The color of each craft corresponds to the country the satellite belongs to, while the radius of the object is determined based on the launch mass.
